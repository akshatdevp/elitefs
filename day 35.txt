            0  1   3   4   2   3    2   0   1   0   2

After that structure is made, kid pour water on it.
How much amount of water can be stored by the structure.

    Input= 0 1 3 4 2 3 2 0 1 0 2
    
    Output= 6
    
    Explanation:
    In the above structure,  6 units of water (w represents the water in the structure)
    can be stored.
